## Title of the Project

### Psycho Relief - A Virtual Cognitive Behavioral Therapist for OCD

## Problem Statement

Many people around the world suffer from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), a condition that can develop due to a variety of factors, including genetics, trauma, stress, or environmental influences. Despite its prevalence, many individuals are reluctant to seek help from a psychiatrist due to family pressures, cultural expectations, or the fear of being judged by society. This hesitation often results in the disorder going untreated, leading to a worsening of symptoms over time.OCD is characterized by intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental rituals (compulsions) that individuals feel compelled to perform in an attempt to alleviate anxiety. However, these compulsions often provide only temporary relief, trapping individuals in a cycle of distress. Left untreated, OCD can significantly impair one's ability to function in everyday life, affecting work, relationships, and overall well-being.In addition to mental health challenges, the stress caused by OCD can lead to physical health issues such as fatigue, headaches, and digestive problems, as well as an increased risk of developing anxiety disorders and depression. Individuals with OCD may find it hard to focus, complete tasks, or enjoy their daily activities, as their minds are frequently preoccupied with obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. This can create a sense of isolation and hopelessness, making it even more difficult for them to seek help.Addressing OCD requires a comprehensive approach, including professional mental health support, therapy, and sometimes medication, yet societal stigma and lack of awareness often prevent individuals from accessing the care they need. Public education about OCD and the importance of seeking timely psychiatric help can play a key role in breaking down barriers and helping those affected reclaim control over their lives.
